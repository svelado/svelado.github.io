			My name is Sidney Velado, affectionately known as Mickey. I am 
			currently a student at Carnegie Mellon, where I am working 
			hard to become a accomplished Mechanical Engineer as well as to work
			on my Robotics minor. I hope someday I can combine both of these
			disciplines in order to make robots that push the boundaries of what
			we do today. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite my current life in the United States, it's wasn't always my 
			home. I was born in Guatemala, and lived in Peru, Bolivia, and 
			finally settled in Costa Rica. I had the privilege to enjoy growing
			up in an amazing tropical climate full of adventures. It made me 
			love the outdoors and drove my passion for soccer, as well as foster
			my sense of Latino culture and pride.
		</p>
		<p>
			Moving to the United States however, didn't make me lose any of that
			but only helped me expand my boundaries. I became interested in 
			new things that I continue to do now at CMU. I picked up interests
			like lacrosse, robotics, and my social fraternity Phi Delta Theta.

		<!-- Embassy Internships -->
		<img src="/static/images/deptOfStateSeal.png">
		<h2> Department of State: Consulate Intern (July-Aug 2013 & 2014)</h2>
		<p>
			The summer of my junior and senior year, I was an intern at the 
			United States Embassy in San José, Costa Rica. I worked for the 
			Consulate office, in charge of American services abroad as well as 
			the distributionof visas to prospective toursits. I had to work in a
			variety of different teams, rotating each week to be exposed to all 
			the different kinds of jobs that were necessary to successfully run 
			the office. Many of my responsibilities were data entry and data 
			analysis, where often times I had to translate documents in English 
			to Spanish and viceversa for official use. Finally, I also had a 
			shift for the main telephone line to respond to general inquiries as
			well as re-directing calls to the proper officers and departments.
		</p>
		<p>
			My other main responsiblity was to serve as an assitant and shadow 
			to one of the office heads. This included researching specific 
			topics and writing reports for them with strict deadlines and 
			evaluations. Also,sometimes included field work which consisted of 
			me accompanying my boss in several trips and meetings with local law
			enforcement.
		</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Department of State: Environmental Hub Intern (June 2015)</h2>
		<p>
			After the my time as an intern in the Consulate , I tried to seek a 
			different department for more experience. I then landed in the 
			Environmental Hub, where my responsibilites were a lot more 
			different. I was tasked with a lot more research extensive tasks 
			that required me to gather data from the internet and phone calls 
			to hotels seeking a certain grade of environmentally friendliness 
			and checking their standards to see if they met our requirements.
			I was also tasked with the responsibility of managing the Hub's 
			facebook page; expanding the Hub's network and posting funding
			opportunities pertaining to environmental pursuits while mantaining  
			the professionalism of a government agency.
		</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Department of State: Political and Economic Office (July 2015)</h2>
		<p>
			During the second half of my internship I was promoted to the 
			Political and Economic Office, a office that focuses more on 
			executives duties and the politics of United States in Costa Rica.
			I worked in a team with 6 others, a team which reported straight to 
			the United States' ambassador.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the ambassador's tenure had just begun that summer, our main
			priority as an office was to get him oriented, well informed with 
			the current political landscape and	with pressing events. Therefore,
			with Costa Rican elections around the corner, my main duty was to 
			prepare reports for the ambassador concerning the current government
			structure and political landscape. This meant I had to research 
			the government structure and compile a presentation of who was under 
			what responsibility withing the government. Additionally, I had to 
			research all the seperate political parties and analyze their 
			history to write a report that will allow the ambassador to know 
			each party's political ideologies and "power players".

		<h2>Carnegie Mellon University Pre-College Counselor (August 2016)</h2>
		<p>Pre-College Counselors are residential staff members who are 
		responsible for all non-academic experiences and activities for students
		in the Carnegie Mellon Pre-College program. Counselors have the most 
		direct out-of-classroom contact with Pre-College students, each being 
		responsible for 15-20 residential students. As a Pre-College counselor
		I had to be ready to advise and supervise my students with whatever
		they might need, may it be academically related or social. I managed
		an entire floor of residents along with a partner and took a class to
		advance my academic standing while holding the position of Counselor.

		<!-- 15112 Term Project -->
		<h2>15-112 Term Project</h2>
		<p>My final project for the 15-112 programming course. I wanted to 
		produce a project that was possible using only the TKinter graphics.
		I also wanted to have a project that was going to be able to demonstrate
		how versatile my knowledge of the language was based on our course 
		material. Finally, I also wanted something that would help me show
		my indvidual learning of python outside of class. </p>
		<p>Ultimately, I created Drawing World, a Microsoft Paint-like 
		application with some added innovation such as voice controls and 
		keyboard shortcuts for an increased work flow. I also added the ability 
		of real time face tracking and image processing by using the Open CV 
		tool</p>

		<!-- Design 1: Gripper Project -->
		<h2>Ancient Artifact Gripper</h2>
		<p>One of our projects for our Mechanical Engineering Design class. We were
		tasked with recovering an "ancient human artifact", an object that our professor
		picks every year. This year our artifact wasnthe worlds first fidget spinner. 
		To be exact, it was actually a large aluminum fidget spinner dummy. Our mission
		was to build a gripper that would be strong enough to hold this artifact. Not only
		did it have to grip the object and lift it but, it also had to grip the object as it
		swung as a pendulum 3 times.
		</p>
		<br>
		<div style='text-align:center'> 
			<img width='720' height='480' src="/static/images/Fidget Spinner.png">
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Our team's gripper had to fit under a motor. With certain geometric constraints 
		vertically and horizontally. Additionally, we couldn't grip the object from the 
		bottom, since it was considered a "restricted" zone. Additionally, the gripper 
		would have to be able to swing down from the side for initial placement.
		</p>
		<br>
		<div style='text-align:center'>
			<img src="/static/images/Swinging Arm.png">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>My group and I knew that our biggest challenge was going to translate the
		motor's torque to translational force and press against the sides of the 
		fidget spinner and hold it while it swings. Thus we came up with a design
		that optimizes this conversion, as well as uses large bevel gears in order to 
		be able to multiply our torque as well as translate our our motion to grip the 
		fidget spinner.
		</p>

		<h2>Acrylic Mechanical Robot: G.O.A.T</h2>
		<p>Another project for our Design I project. This time we were tasked with
		creating a mechanical robot with a "starter kit" created by the course teaching
		staff. We are also provided with 3 different test stages. Rocks, stairs, and hurdles.
		We used all that data to design our robot to clear all the stages together.	
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Our procedure includes analyzing an animal in nature and then, modeling our 
		robot after it. Our team chose the goat, due to its ability to climb rough terrain
		and stablity. We found a goat video online, and traced coupler curves of its movement. 
		We then used MotionGen to model those coupler curves and ended up with a Roshaf-Crank Rocker,
		that simulated a goat walking. We built our robot and optomized other elements like,
		the legs to make what we believe to be the best design. Below is a full presentation
		of our process with all necessary data.

		<!-- Personal Website Project -->
		<h2>mvelado Github.io</h2>
			
		<p>Starting my sophomore year I realized that it would be a good idea to 
		get a personal website. Whether it be for employers or any other future 
		use, a website would be a really useful project. Despite easy to use
		websites creation services such as Wordpress or Weebly, I opted to 
		create my own website from scratch. I began to learn HTML, CSS, and Java
		Script through internet research and Code Academy.
		</p>

		<p>I was then ready to create and deploy my own website, the result 
		which you are using right now. I used the developer tools Bootstrap,
		Google Fonts, and Google Colors in order to model my website after my 
		favorite Sublime 3 theme, the Materials Theme. Finally, I also learned
		git and how to use it in order to deploy my website and have it hosted
		on github pages for others to access.

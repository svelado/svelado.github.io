			My name is Sidney Velado, also known as Mickey. I am currently a
			Mechanical Engineering and Robotics double major at Carnegie Mellon.
			I hope someday I can combine both of these disciplines in order to make
			robots that push the boundaries of what we do today. I'm really interested
			 in learning more about software in Robotics, specifically computer vision.
			  In my free time I love to watch European football and am an avid
			supporter of the Arsenal Gunners. I also enjoy playing video games, with
			God Of War being the latest game I binged.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite currently living in the United States, it's wasn't always my
			home. I was born in Guatemala, and lived in Peru, Bolivia, and
			finally settled in Costa Rica. I had the privilege to enjoy growing
			up in an amazing tropical climate full of adventures. It made me
			love the outdoors and drove my passion for football, as well as foster
			my sense of Latino culture and pride, which shines in everything I do at
			Carnegie Mellon.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides my current academics at CMU, I also have served in multiple student
			organizations. I am active in my fraternity Phi Delta Theta where I served
			as Social Chair as well as the IM Chair. I also serve in the Spanish and
			Latino Student Association as the Internal Outreach Chair and as a general
			member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.

		<h2>Carnegie Mellon University Biorobotics Labratory (Summer 2018)</h2>
		<p> Over the summer, I began working in the Robotics Institute Biorobotics
	    Laboratory. I had the privilidge to continue the project started by a
	    graduate student Daniel Piedrahita, under the guidance of a PhD candidate
	    Steve Crews. The project called the Flyped, was a bipdeal robot with an
	    actuator that it could use a wheel for movement as well as a actuator to
	    maintain its balance while in bipedal mode. I have used my skills in
	    Solidworks to provide a lot of the CAD and make hardware upgrades.
	    Additionally, I have used my machinery skills to bring the concepts to life
	    and produce the parts I model. I have also been working on the software side
	    in a Linux Environment (Ubuntu 16.04) as well. Our robot is running ROS, in
	    which I have implemented both C++ and Python in order to make a ROS package for
	    our robot. It is currently running a simple PID controller, but we are in
	    the process of upgrading it to a LQR controller. I am continuing my research
	    throught the rest of my school year at Carnegie Mellon and look forwared to
	    learning more and hopefully a breakthrough in research!

		<h2>Carnegie Mellon University Pre-College Counselor (Summer 2016)</h2>
		<p>Pre-College Counselors are residential staff members who are
		responsible for all non-academic experiences and activities for students
		in the Carnegie Mellon Pre-College program. Counselors have the most
		direct out-of-classroom contact with Pre-College students, each being
		responsible for 15-20 residential students. As a Pre-College counselor
		I had to be ready to advise and supervise my students with whatever
		they might need, may it be academically related or social. I managed
		an entire floor of residents along with a partner and took a class to
		advance my academic standing while holding the position of Counselor.

		<!-- Embassy Internships -->
		<img src="static/images/deptOfStateSeal.png">
		<h2> Department of State: Consulate Intern (Summer 2013 & Summer 2014)</h2>
		<p>
			The summer of my junior and senior year, I was an intern at the
			United States Embassy in San José, Costa Rica. I worked for the
			Consulate office, in charge of American services abroad as well as
			the distribution of visas to prospective toursits. I had to work in a
			variety of different teams, rotating each week to be exposed to all
			the different kinds of jobs that were necessary to successfully run
			the office. Many of my responsibilities were data entry and data
			analysis, where often times I had to translate documents in English
			to Spanish and viceversa for official use. Finally, I also had a
			shift for the main telephone line to respond to general inquiries as
			well as re-directing calls to the proper officers and departments.
		</p>
		<p>
			My other main responsiblity was to serve as an assitant and shadow
			to one of the office heads. This included researching specific
			topics and writing reports for them with strict deadlines and
			evaluations. Also,sometimes included field work which consisted of
			me accompanying my boss in several trips and meetings with local law
			enforcement.
		</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Department of State: Environmental Hub Intern (June 2015)</h2>
		<p>
			After the my time as an intern in the Consulate , I tried to seek a
			different department for more experience. I then landed in the
			Environmental Hub, where my responsibilites were a lot more
			different. I was tasked with a lot more research extensive tasks
			that required me to gather data from the internet and phone calls
			to hotels seeking a certain grade of environmentally friendliness
			and checking their standards to see if they met our requirements.
			I was also tasked with the responsibility of managing the Hub's
			facebook page; expanding the Hub's network and posting funding
			opportunities pertaining to environmental pursuits while mantaining
			the professionalism of a government agency.
		</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Department of State: Political and Economic Office (July 2015)</h2>
		<p>
			During the second half of my internship I was promoted to the
			Political and Economic Office, a office that focuses more on
			executives duties and the politics of United States in Costa Rica.
			I worked in a team with 6 others, a team which reported straight to
			the United States' ambassador.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the ambassador's tenure had just begun that summer, our main
			priority as an office was to get him oriented, well informed with
			the current political landscape and	with pressing events. Therefore,
			with Costa Rican elections around the corner, my main duty was to
			prepare reports for the ambassador concerning the current government
			structure and political landscape. This meant I had to research
			the government structure and compile a presentation of who was under
			what responsibility withing the government. Additionally, I had to
			research all the seperate political parties and analyze their
			history to write a report that will allow the ambassador to know
			each party's political ideologies and "power players".

		<h2>Urban Search and Rescue</h2>
		<p>A project in 16-311, our Introduction to Robotics class. We were tasked with
			and open ended project to produce a robot that would be run in a challenge
			Urban Search and Rescue simulation. Our robot had to have a robust navigation
			ability, with a design optimal to what we considered the most imporant things
			that an urban search and rescue robot need. Additionally, the robot had to have
			a microcontroller subsystem that see and project lights that used to open
			doors as well as a light for its own navigation. Cameras were provided as
			the main way to percieve the robot's location and control it remotely. We
			had a checkpoint that then culminated in a final competition where we ended
			up in the finalist round. We were allowed to use anything from our provided
			lego mindstorms kit as well as anything 3D printed or machined as long as
			long as it met our gemotric constraints as well as passed a drop test.
		</p>

		<p>
		Our robot was optimized to climb the stairs in our challenge course. Our team
		thought that if we could clear the stairs, we would be able to clear most "rubble"
		and navigation obstacles that were presented to us. We also knew that lighting
		would be key to give us the best camera feed that in turn provided us with
		the best possible navigations, so we focused on those two things and ended up doing
		really well in the competion and in the assignment. Below is a video example
		of the same project done in 2013.</p>

		<!-- GOAT Section -->
		<h2>Acrylic Mechanical Robot: G.O.A.T</h2>
		<p>Another project for our Design I project. This time we were tasked with
		creating a mechanical robot with a "starter kit" created by the course teaching
		staff. We are also provided with 3 different test stages. Rocks, stairs, and hurdles.
		We used all that data to design our robot to clear all the stages together.
		</p>

		<p>
		Our procedure includes analyzing an animal in nature and then, modeling our
		robot after it. Our team chose the goat, due to its ability to climb rough terrain
		and stablity. We found a goat video online, and traced coupler curves of its movement.
		We then used MotionGen to model those coupler curves and ended up with a Roshaf-Crank Rocker,
		that simulated a goat walking. We built our robot and optomized other elements like,
		the legs to make what we believe to be the best design. Below is a full presentation
		of our process with all necessary data.

		<!-- Design 1: Gripper Project -->
		<h2>Ancient Artifact Gripper</h2>
		<p>One of our projects for our Design class. We were
		tasked with recovering an "ancient human artifact", an object that our professor
		picks every year. This year our artifact was the world's "first fidget spinner".
		To be exact, it was actually a large aluminum fidget spinner dummy. Our mission
		was to build a gripper that would be strong enough to hold this artifact. Not only
		did it need to have the strength to grip the object and lift it but, it also
		hold the objects tightly as it swung like a pendulum 3 times.
		</p>
		<br>
		<div style='text-align:center'>
			<img width='720' height='480' src="static/images/Fidget Spinner.png">
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Our team's gripper had to fit under a motor. With certain geometric constraints
		vertically and horizontally. Additionally, we couldn't grip the object from the
		bottom, since it was considered a "restricted" zone. So we built a design that
		avoided these physical constraints and completed the task successfully.
		</p>
		<br>
		<div style='text-align:center'>
			<img src="static/images/Swinging Arm.png">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>My group and I knew that our biggest challenge was going to translate the
		motor's torque to  a linear force of the contacts that would press against the sides of the
		fidget spinner and hold it while it swings. Thus we came up with a design
		that optimizes this conversion, which uses large bevel gears in order to
		be able to multiply our torque as well as translate our our motion to grip the
		fidget spinner.

		<!-- 15112 Term Project -->
		<h2>Drawing World</h2>
		<p>My final project for 15-112, Fundamentals of Programming. Our assignment
		was to make an application in Python to present as our final project. I wanted to
		produce a project that was possible using only the TkInter graphics.
		But, also wanted to have a project that was going to be able to demonstrate
		how versatile my knowledge of the language was based on our course
		material. Finally, I also wanted something that would be fun and interesting
		to use. </p>
		<p>Ultimately, I created Drawing World, a Microsoft Paint-like
		application with some added innovation such as voice controls and
		keyboard shortcuts for an increased work flow. I also added the ability
		of real time face tracking and image processing by using the Open CV. Shout
		out to my professor David Kosbie for letting me use him in the video.

		<!-- Personal Website Project -->
		<h2>mvelado.github.io</h2>

		<p>Starting my sophomore year I realized that it would be a good idea to
		get a personal website. Whether it be for employers or any other future
		use, a website would be a really useful project. Despite easy to use
		websites creation services such as Wordpress or Weebly, I opted to
		create my own website from scratch, to challenge myself and learn about
		programming websites. I began to learn HTML, CSS, and Java
		Script through searching the internet and practicing on my own.
		</p>

		<p>Once I was ready to create and deploy my own website I started working at it;
		the result is what you are using right now. I had originally used the developer
		tools Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and Google Colors in order to model my website after my
		favorite Sublime 3 theme, the Materials Theme. However, I felt that it looked
		a little weird and that the inexperience I had in web development showed.
		Therefore I recently (May 2018) updated it to reflect what I know now. I
		kept the same look in terms of the navigation bar and page layout, but made
		a lot more changes. First, I changed it to a better color scheme and added
		little robot visuals to enhance the look of the site. I also added animations to the
		navigation bar and cleaned up the code so the spacing of the site actually
		makes sense. Finally, I updated it with recent information and added the all
		important copyright at the bottom.

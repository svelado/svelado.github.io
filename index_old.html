							I am a professional, enthusiastic, and hard-working
							student with a passion for Robotics. I am currently a student at

							academic research. I specialize in hardware, rapid prototyping,
                            and building robots from the ground up. Nevertheless I am not
                            afraid to implement different path planning algorithms, vision algorithms and
                            controllers. I hope someday I can use all my robotics
                            knowledge to improve our world and many people's lives.

						My name is Sidney Miguel Velado, but I often go by Mickey.
                        I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering and
                        Robotics at Carnegie Mellon. I hope someday I can
                        combine my studys to push the boundaries of what robots
                        can do. In my free time I love to watch European
                        football and am an avid supporter of Arsenal FC. I also
                        enjoy playing video games, with God Of War being one of
                        my favorite game series.
					</p>
					<p align='left'>
						Despite currently living in the United States, it's wasn't always my
						home. I was born in Guatemala, and lived in Peru, Bolivia, and
						finally settled in Costa Rica. I had the privilege to enjoy growing
						up in an amazing tropical climate full of adventures. It made me
						love the outdoors and drove my passion for football, as well as foster
						my sense of Latino culture and pride, which shines in everything I do.

					<h2>Staples - Robotics Engineer Intern</h2>
					<p>This summer I had the pleasure of being an intern for one
                    of the most iconic companies in the United States. Fresh off
                    a rebrand, its been an exciting time to work at Staples.
                    Staples is evolving in every facet possible, planning for
                    the future to bring itself into our new technology era.
                    One of these evolutions, is relying less on outside
                    companies for their technological needs, and instead
                    developing that technology in house. In the case of robotics,
                    there are multiple supply chain operations and automation
                    tasks that the company want to tackle with robotics.
                    It is an ambitious task to establish a robotics department
                    with no prior knowledge or expertise in that field; but a
                    task that Staples is up for. Given my previous experience,
                    I was brought on to help with this project as a Robotics
                    Engineer Intern. I was a part of a small team of 7 people;
                    where we focused building certain products, as well as
                    developing core technologies that can be used across
                    multiple different projects. I have not worked at a startup,
                    but I imagine it is similar to this. Week in and week out
                    we had to preform to show key stakeholders that we had what
                    it took to bring the Robotics Department to life. Despite
                    being such a small team it was impressive how we managed to
                    cover most areas of expertise. I was the expert when it
                    came to controls and hardware design. Many of my projects
                    focused on developing core technologies for this, and I used
                    my design skills to build different robots, work with
                    different test platforms, as well as multiple mechatronics
                    systems to test different technologies. I had a lot of
                    responsiblity, which included me roadmapping my main project
                    with milestones and deliverables, as well as presenting my
                    work to executives in the company. I am grateful to Staples
                    for giving me the opportunity to apply all the skills I
                    learned at Carnegie Mellon, and giving me an environment
                    where I was constantly challenged to do my best. I will
                    always keep everything I learned and my amazing memories of
                    my summer in Boston and Staples close to me as I seek new
                    challenges!

					<h2>Robotics Institute: Biorobotics Laboratory</h2>
					<p>The summer of after my junior year, I began working in
                        the Robotics Institute Biorobotics Laboratory, ran by
                        Professor Howie Choset. I had the privilege to continue
                        the project started by master student Daniel
                        Piedrahita, under the guidance of a PhD candidate Steve
                        Crews. The project called the Flyped, was a bipdeal
                        robot with a fly wheel which it uses to maintain balance
                        and accomplish complex movements. I used my C++ and
                        Python skills to create the ROS package to implement our
                        controller. I also used my Solidworks skills to make
                        multiple different components for our robot, and even
                        redesigned the entire robot from scratch. I am excited
                        to be a part of the group of students working on some
                        cutting edge research and look forward to publishing
                        something soon!</p>

					<h2>Computational Engineering and Robotics Laboratory</h2>
					<p>Even thought I continued to be part of the Biorobotics
                        Lab during the academic year, I was looking for more
                        opportunities in research to learn more about robotics.
						I joined professor Kenji Shimada's lab, the Computational
                        Engineering and Robotics Lab (CERLAB). I began working
                        on a project for a Japanese shipping company, Tsuneishi.
						The project focuses on cleaning the biomaterial build up
                        on ships with an autonomous robot. Unlike my experience at
                        the Biorobotics lab, in my new team I have the most
                        robotics experience, which has pushed me more
                        into a leadership role. It helped me pick up valuable
                        skills like learn how to manage a project schedule as
                        well as personell. Additionally, it pushed me into more
                        algorithm problems about path planning and controls.
                        I look forward to do my best and prove that I can
                        contribute to a project with my technical skills as well
						as lead a project. Check back for updates!</p>

					<h2>Carnegie Mellon University Pre-College Counselor (Summer 2016)</h2>
					<p>Pre-College Counselors are residential staff members who are
					responsible for all non-academic experiences and activities for students
					in the Carnegie Mellon Pre-College program. Counselors have the most
					direct out-of-classroom contact with Pre-College students, each being
					responsible for 15-20 residential students. As a Pre-College counselor
					I had to be ready to advise and supervise my students with whatever
					they might need, may it be academically related or social. I managed
					an entire floor of residents along with a partner and took a class to
					advance my academic standing while holding the position of Counselor.

					<h2>Department of State Consulate and Political and Economic Office Internship</h2>
					<p>
						The summer of my junior and senior year, I was an intern at the
						United States Embassy in San José, Costa Rica. I worked for the
						Consulate office, in charge of American services abroad as well as
						the distribution of visas to prospective toursits. I had to work in a
						variety of different teams, rotating each week to be exposed to all
						the different kinds of jobs that were necessary to successfully run
						the office. Many of my responsibilities were data entry and data
						analysis, where often times I had to translate documents in English
						to Spanish and viceversa for official use. Finally, I also had a
						shift for the main telephone line to respond to general inquiries as
						well as re-directing calls to the proper officers and departments.
					</p>

					<p>
						During the second half of my internship I was promoted to the
						Political and Economic Office, a office that focuses more on
						executives duties and the politics of United States in Costa Rica.
						I worked in a team with 6 others, a team which reported straight to
						the United States' ambassador.
